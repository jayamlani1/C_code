Question:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Code:


void moveZeroes(int* nums, int numsSize){

    int i=0,j=0;
    /* The algo is simple, look for zero, as soon as you find zero, start looking for non-zero and now
     * replace the non-zero with the zero. Move ahead look for next zero and if found look for next 
     * non-zero.
     * There will be some repetition in the end. But I can't think of better idea in short term.
     */
    for(i=0;i< numsSize;i++)
    {
        if(nums[i]==0)
        {
            for(j=i+1;j<numsSize;j++)
            {
                if(nums[j]!=0)
                {
                    
                    nums[i]=nums[j];
                    nums[j]=0;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
